** LORIA/SYNALP EmotionML Implementation

The LORIA/SYNALP implementation of EmotionML is a Java standalone library developed in the context of the ITEA Empathic Products project by the LORIA/SYNALP team. 
It enables to import Java objects from EmotionML XML files and export them to EmotionML as well. It guarantees standard compliance by performing a two steps validation 
after all export operations and before all import operations: first the EmotionML schema is tested, then all EmotionML assertions are tested. If one or the other fails, 
an error message is produced and the document cannot be imported or exported. The library contains a corpus of badly formatted EmotionML files that enables to double check 
if both the schema and the assertions manage to correctly invalidate them. The API is hosted on google code (https://code.google.com/p/loria-synalp-emotionml/) and is 
released under the MIT License.
