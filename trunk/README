The LORIA/SYNALP implementation of EmotionML is a Java standalone library developed in the context of the ITEA Empathic Products project by the LORIA/SYNALP team. 
It enables to import Java objects from EmotionML XML files and export them to EmotionML as well. It guarantees standard compliance by performing a two steps validation 
after all export operations and before all import operations: first the EmotionML schema is tested, then all EmotionML assertions are tested. If one or the other fails, 
an error message is produced and the document cannot be imported or exported. The library contains a corpus of badly formatted EmotionML files that enables to double check 
if both the schema and the assertions manage to correctly invalidate them. The API is hosted on google code (https://code.google.com/p/loria-synalp-emotionml/) and is 
released under the MIT License.

* Restrictions
	- 1 single text node for emotions
	- no JSON export for emotions with text


* Troubleshooting
	- Access restriction for class IllegalAnnotationsException: in Eclipse, make sure that the JRE System Library is the workspace default


* Todo
	- improve exceptions handling (with embedded exceptions)
	- add licenses for packaged jars
	- remove not used jars

* Comments
	- assertion 607 does not specify that the name attribute of vocabulary <item> elements must be of type xs:NMTOKEN ans as such cannot contain space characters or commas
	
* ChangeLog
	v0.1 - first version
	v0.2 - added marshalling/unmarshalling of <info> elements with JAXB	
	v0.2.1 - separated stream writing/reading from export/import
	v0.2.2 - improved JAXB to create the context only once
	v0.2.3 - added a (end>=start) assertion test and validation of embedded emotions.
	v0.2.4 - added/fixed copy constructors
	v0.2.5 - fixed dimension trace/value copy constructors
	v0.3 - added a method to push vocabularies from emotion level to document level, added unsetters to VocabularyReferrer
